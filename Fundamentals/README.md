# Web Scraping

<img src="./images/web-scraping.png">

**Web scraping** is the automated process of extracting data from websites. This data extraction is typically done by a **web scraper**, which is a program or script designed to navigate websites, locate specific pieces of information, and save them in a structured format (such as CSV, JSON, or databases) for analysis, reporting, or other uses.

## How Web Scraping Works?

Web scraping usually involves the following steps:
1. **Sending HTTP Requests**: The web scraper sends a request (typically HTTP GET) to the target website’s server to access a web page.
    > Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol that transfers resources (web-based), such as HTML documents, between a client and a web server. HTTP is a stateless protocol that follows the client-server model. Clients (web browsers) and web servers communicate or exchange information using HTTP requests and HTTP responses.
2. **Parsing the HTML**: Once the server responds with the HTML of the page, the scraper parses the HTML to locate specific elements.
3. **Locating and Extracting Data**: Using HTML tags, attributes, and classes (like `<div>`, `<span>`, `class="title"`, etc.), the scraper pinpoints and extracts the relevant data.
4. **Storing the Data**: The extracted data is then organized and stored in a structured format, such as CSV, JSON, or a database.

#### Example Use Cases for Web Scraping
- **Price Comparison**: Aggregating product prices from different e-commerce sites.
- **Market Research**: Collecting data on competitors, customer reviews, or trends.
- **Content Aggregation**: Gathering news, articles, or blog posts from multiple sources.
- **Job Listings**: Scraping job listings from various job boards for data analysis.
- **Real Estate Listings**: Extracting property data for analysis or listing on another platform.

#### Tools and Libraries for Web Scraping
There are various tools and libraries designed for web scraping, depending on the level of control and the programming language you prefer:
- **Python Libraries**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium (for JavaScript-heavy sites).
- **Dedicated Tools**: Octoparse, ParseHub, or web scraping APIs like ScraperAPI.

#### Ethical and Legal Considerations
Web scraping has legal and ethical implications, as some websites have terms of service prohibiting automated access. It's important to:
- **Respect Robots.txt**: Check the website's `robots.txt` file to see what pages allow or disallow scraping.
- **Avoid Overloading Servers**: Set reasonable delays between requests to prevent overwhelming the server.
- **Abide by Terms of Service**: Ensure that your scraping practices comply with the website’s terms of service and applicable laws.

In summary, web scraping is a powerful tool for gathering data automatically from websites. However, it should be done responsibly and ethically to ensure respect for site owners and users.
