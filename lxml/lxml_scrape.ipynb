      "<heading id=\"h-0002\" level=\"1\">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">This invention relates generally to optical systems that monitor parameters related to oxygen levels in tissue. More and sheaths for the optical probes that shield the optical probes from contaminants during use and specifically, the present invention relates to optical probes, such as compact, handheld oximeters, communicate status information to the optical probes regarding contaminant protection so that the optical probes are reusable.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Oximeters are medical devices used to measure the oxygen saturation of tissue in humans and living things for various purposes. For example, oximeters are used for medical and diagnostic purposes in hospitals and other medical facilities (e.g., operating rooms for surgery, recovery room for patient monitoring, or ambulance or other mobile monitoring for, e.g., hypoxia); sports and athletic purposes at a sports arena (e.g., professional athlete monitoring); personal or at-home monitoring of individuals (e.g., general health monitoring, or person training for a marathon); and veterinary purposes (e.g., animal monitoring).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">In particular, assessing a patient's oxygen saturation, at both the regional and local levels, is important as it is an indicator of the state of the patient's health. Thus, oximeters are often used in clinical settings, such as during surgery and recovery, where it can be suspected that the patient's tissue oxygenation state is unstable. For example, during surgery, oximeters should be able to quickly deliver accurate oxygen saturation measurements under a variety of non-ideal conditions.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Pulse oximeters and tissue oximeters are two types of oximeters that operate on different principles. A pulse oximeter requires a pulse in order to function. A pulse oximeter typically measures the absorbance of light due to pulsing arterial blood. In contrast, a tissue oximeter does not require a pulse in order to function, and can be used to make oxygen saturation measurements of a tissue flap that has been disconnected from a blood supply.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">Human tissue, as an example, includes a variety of light-absorbing molecules. Such chromophores include oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, melanin, water, lipid, and cytochrome. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins are the dominant chromophores in tissue for much of the visible and near-infrared spectral range. Light absorption differs significantly for oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins at certain wavelengths of light. Tissue oximeters can measure oxygen levels in human tissue by exploiting these light-absorption differences.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">Despite the success of existing oximeters, there is a continuing desire to improve oximeters by, for example, improving the reuse of oximeters; reducing or eliminating contamination during use; improving remote communication; improving measurement accuracy; reducing measurement time; lowering cost through reuse; reducing size, weight, or form factor; reducing power consumption; and for other reasons, and any combination of these.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">Therefore, there is a need for improved tissue oximetry devices and methods of shielding oximetry devices during use for reuse of the devices.</p>\n",
      "<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">Embodiments relate to a compact, handheld oximeter and measurement averaging of oximetry readings performed by the handheld oximeter. The average measurement and real-time oximetry readings can be displayed on a display of the oximeter to provide medical professionals with valuable oximetry information useful for diagnosing an oximetry state of patient tissue.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">In an implementation, an oximetry device is sealed in a sheath where a user can contact the sheath to a number of different tissue locations to allow the oximetry device to make oximetry measurements of the tissue. The oximetry device averages two or more of the oximetry readings by detecting the sheath being placed in contact with the tissue locations and being lifted from contact from the tissue locations. The average is generated and displayed on a display of the oximetry device for the oximetry readings if the lifts are made while use directions for the lifts are displayed on a display of the oximetry device. The averages are not generated if the lifts are not made while the user directions for the lifts are not displayed. The averages are simultaneously displayed with the oximetry readings which are instantaneous measurement for patient tissue. The averaging allows a user of the oximetry device to monitor the oximetry information as an average as tissue conditions of the tissue change during a surgery. Being able to monitor how the average value changes over time by viewing the average displayed on the display allows the user to obtain a history of the tissue during the surgery to perform more successful surgeries, such as tissue flap surgeries where real-time and average oximetry information of a tissue flap allows for the flap to be trimmed or not trimmed based on the real-time and average information for more successful flap grafting.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">Spectroscopy has been used for noninvasive measurements of various physiological properties in animal and human subjects. Visible (e.g., red light) and near-infrared spectroscopy is often utilized because physiological tissues have relatively low scattering in these spectral ranges. Human tissues, for example, include numerous light-absorbing chromophores, such as oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, melanin, water, lipid, and cytochrome. The hemoglobins are the dominant chromophores in tissue for much of the visible and near-infrared spectral range and via light absorption, contribute to the color of human tissues. In the visible and near-infrared range, oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins have significantly different absorption features. Accordingly, visible and near-infrared spectroscopy has been applied to exploit these different absorption features for measuring oxygen levels in physiological media, such as tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sometimes referred to as oxygen saturation) and total hemoglobin concentrations.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">Spatially-resolved spectroscopy (SRS) is one type of visible and near-infrared spectroscopy that allows tissue absorption to be determined independently from tissue scattering, thereby allowing absolute measurements of chromophore concentrations, such as oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins. More specifically, an SRS instrument may emit light into tissue through a light source and collect the diffusely reflected light at two or more detectors positioned at different distances from the light source.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">One field in which visible and near-infrared spectroscopy, such as SRS, is useful in tissue flap surgery in which a tissue flap is moved from one location on a patient to another location for reconstructive surgery. Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy techniques can be used to measure oxygen saturation in a tissue flap so that the viability of the tissue flap can be determined in surgery and after surgery. Intraoperative tissue flap oximetry probes that employ visible and near-infrared SRS should be able to quickly deliver accurate oxygen saturation measurements under a variety of non-ideal conditions.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">This patent describes some examples of implementations with specific dimensions, measurements, temperatures, values, percentages, and times. These are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form described. The specific dimensions, measurements, temperatures, values, percentages, and times are approximate values. These values can vary due to, for example, measurement or manufacturing variations or tolerances or other factors. For example, depending on the tightness of the manufacturing and measurement tolerances, the temperature and time values can vary plus or minus 2 percent, 2.5 percent, plus or minus 5 percent, plus or minus 7.5 percent, plus or minus 10 percent, plus or minus 12.5 percent, plus or minus 15 percent, plus or minus 20 percent, or plus or minus 25 percent, or other ranges.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">Further, the values are for a specific implementation, and other implementations can have different values, such as certain values made larger for a larger-scaled sized process or product, or smaller for a smaller-scaled process or product. A device, apparatus, or process may be made proportionally larger or smaller by adjusting relative measurements proportionally (e.g., maintaining the same or about the same ratio between different measurements). In various implementations, the values can be the same as the value given, about the same of the value given, at least or greater than the value given, or can be at most or less than the value given, or any combination of these.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">Some flow implementations are presented in this patent, but it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific flows and steps presented. A flow may have additional steps (not necessarily described in this application), different steps which replace some of the steps presented, fewer steps or a subset of the steps presented, or steps in a different order than presented, or any combination of these. Further, the steps in other implementations may not be exactly the same as the steps presented and may be modified or altered as appropriate for a particular application or based on the data.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">An implementation of the invention includes a probe, such as the described system unit or laparoscopic oximeter, and accompanying techniques to calculate and display an average oxygen saturation measurement of a number of previous measurements. The average measurement can be reset by the user by making a gesture with the probe. An example of a gesture is inverting the probe, relative to its standard operating orientation. And then after returning the probe to its standard operating orientation, the average value will be reset or initialized, and calculating of the average value will start at a count of 1. The instantaneous or instant oxygen saturation value can be displayed on the same screen as the average value, so that the user will be able to compare the oxygen saturation value with the average value of previous oxygen saturation measurements.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">An accelerometer integrated circuit or chip is used to detect gestures or motion of the probe. The probe can be an oximeter, such as a tissue oximeter or pulse oximeter, which makes oxygen saturation measurements. The probe can be a standalone probe, where the unit is self contained, and the oxygen saturation measurements and calculations to determine these measurements and the average values are contained within an enclosure of the standalone probe. Some components of the standalone probe include a processor, memory, display, signal emitters, light detectors, batteries (e.g., disposable or rechargeable), accelerometer, and others.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">In other implementations, the probe can be a connected wirelessly (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) or wired to another device or unit (e.g., system unit, smartphone, or display console, or combination) or a number of devices or units, or to the cloud via a network or the Internet. The components and calculations can be divided among the connected devices or the cloud. For example, data from the probe can be transmitted to another device for determine of the oxygen saturation value and average saturation value, and then these value can be displayed on a screen separate from the probe. In such implementations, the components resident on the probe can be, for example, signal emitters, light detectors, the accelerometer (to detect gestures), and wireless or wired interface circuits; the processor and memory can be external to the probe. By removing some of the components, this would reduce the size and power consumption of the probe.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">Various data structures can be used to implement the oxygen saturation averaging feature. In an implementation, there is a first memory location to accumulate a sum of the previous instant oxygen saturation measurements and a second memory location to keep a count of the number of measurements made. The second memory location may be referred to as a counter. The second memory location can have a maximum value, and if the maximum value is achieved, then no further measurements will be added to the first memory location. And the average displayed on the screen will no longer change or update, even when further instant oxygen saturation measurement are made and displayed.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">Other data structures may be used to implement the oxygen saturation averaging feature, and more specifically a rolling or continuous moving average. For example, the instant oxygen saturation measurements may be stored in a queue data structure (e.g., implemented using an array or linked list structure). There can be a first memory location to keep a sum of the values in the queue, or the sum can be calculated by an arithmetic logic unit each time an average is desired. And another memory location will keep a count of the number of entries in the queue. The count may have a maximum value. And when that is achieved, the first oxygen saturation added to the queue will be removed (first-in, first-out or FIFO operation) and its value subtracted from sum memory location. The values in the queue will be moved back one location in the queue. And a current instant oxygen saturation measurement is added at an end of the queue. Other data structures and techniques can be used to implement a moving or rolling average.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">The components are linked together via a bus <b>303</b>, which represents the system bus architecture of the system unit. Although <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows one bus that connects to each component of the system unit, bus <b>303</b> is illustrative of any interconnection scheme that links the components of the system unit. For example, one or more bus subsystems can interconnect one or more of the components of the system unit. Additionally, the bus subsystem may interconnect components through one or more ports, such as an audio port (e.g., a 2.5-millimeter or 3.5-millimeter audio jack port), a universal serial bus (USB) port, or another port. Components of the system unit may also be connected to the processor via direct connections, such as direct connections through a printed circuit board (PCB).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">In an implementation, system unit <b>301</b> includes a sensor probe <b>346</b>. The sensor probe includes a probe tip <b>338</b> and a connector <b>336</b>. The probe tip is connected to the connector via a first communication link <b>342</b> and a second communication link <b>344</b>. First communication link <b>342</b> may include an electrical wire, a set of electrical wires (e.g., a ribbon cable), a waveguide (e.g., fiber optic cables), a set of waveguides (e.g., a set of fiber optic cables), a wireless communication link, or any combination of these types of links. The second communication link may include an electrical wire, a set of electrical wires (e.g., a ribbon cable), a waveguide (e.g., a fiber optic cable), a set of waveguides (e.g., a set of fiber optic cables), a wireless communication link, or any combination of these types of links. The electrical wire or sets of electrical wires of the first communication link, the second communication link, or both can include one or more electrical traces on a printed circuit board.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">The connector connects (e.g., removably connects) the probe tip, the wires, waveguides, or any combination of these elements to the signal emitter and signal detector of the system unit. For example, a communication link <b>343</b> may connect the signal emitter to the connector and a communication link <b>345</b> may connect the signal detector to the connector. Each of the communication links <b>343</b> and <b>345</b> may include an electrical wire, a set of electrical wires (e.g., a ribbon cable) one waveguide, a set of waveguides, a wireless communication link, or any combination of these links. Each communication link can also include one or more electrical traces on a printed circuit board. For example, the connector may include one or more connectors that are mounted on a PCB. Communication links <b>342</b>, <b>344</b>, or either one of these links may be ribbon cables that connect to the probe tip and connect to connectors mounted on a PCB. In this implementation, communication links <b>343</b> and <b>345</b> can be electrical traces on the PCB that link to the single emitter, signal detector, or both. In this implementation, the signal emitters and signal detectors may be electrical emitters and detectors that control light emitters, light detectors, or both in the probe tip.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">In an implementation where the probe tip is separable from the system unit <b>301</b>, connector <b>336</b> may have a locking feature, such as an insert connector that may twist or screw to lock. If so, the connector is more securely held to the system unit and it will need to be unlocked before it can be removed. This will help prevent the accidental removal of the probe tip from the system unit.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">The connector may also have a first keying feature, so that the connector can only be inserted into a connector receptacle of the system unit in one or more specific orientations. This will ensure that proper connections are made.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">The connector may also have a second keying feature that provides an indication to the system unit that a type of probe (e.g., a probe from many different types of probes) that is attached. The system unit may be adapted to make measurements for a number of different types of probes. When a probe is inserted in the system unit, the system uses the second keying feature to determine the type of probe that is connected to the system unit. Then the system unit can perform the appropriate functions, use the appropriate algorithms, or otherwise make adjustments in its operation for the specific probe type.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">In an implementation, signal emitter <b>331</b> includes one or more light sources that emit light (visible light, infrared light, or both) at one or more specific wavelengths. In a specific implementation, the light sources emit five or more wavelengths of light (e.g., 730 nanometers, 760 nanometers, 810 nanometers, 845 nanometers, and 895 nanometers). Other wavelengths of light are emitted by the light sources, including shorter and longer wavelengths of light in other implementations. The signal emitter may include one or more laser diodes or one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\">In an implementation, signal emitter <b>331</b> is an emitter that emits electrical signals to one or more light sources, which may emit light based on the received electrical signals. In some implementations, the signal emitter includes one or more light sources and electrical signal emitters that are connected to the light sources.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\">In an implementation, signal detector <b>333</b> includes one or more photodetectors capable of detecting the light at the wavelengths produced and emitted by the signal emitter. In another implementation, the signal detector <b>333</b> is an electrical signal detector that detects electrical signals generated by one or more photodetectors. In another implementation, the signal detector includes one or more photodetectors and one or more electrical detectors that are connected to the photodetectors.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\">In an implementation, HID <b>319</b> is a device that is adapted to allow a user to input commands into the system unit. The HID may include one or more buttons, one or more slider devices, one or more accelerometers, a computer mouse, a keyboard, a touch interface device (e.g., a touch interface of display <b>307</b>), a voice interface device, or another HID.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">In an implementation where the HID is an accelerometer and the system unit is a handheld unit, the accelerometer may detect movements (e.g., gestures) of the system unit where the system unit may be moved by a user. Movements may include a left movement, right movement, forward movement, back movement, up movement, down movement, one or more rotational movements (e.g., about one or more axes of rotation, such as the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, or another axis), any combinations of these movements, or other movements.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\">Information for the various movements detected by the accelerometer may be transmitted to the processor to control one or more systems of the system unit. For example, an upward movement (e.g., a lifting movement) may be transmitted to the processor for powering on the system unit. Alternatively, if the system unit is set down and left unmoved for a predetermined period of time, then the processor may interpret the lack of movement detected by the accelerometer as a standby mode signal and may place the system unit in a standby power mode (a lower power mode than a normal operation mode where oximetry measurements can be made by the system unit), or a power-down signal and may power down the system unit.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">When the system unit is powered on, information for a left movement or a right movement detected by the accelerometer and transmitted to the processor may be used by the processor to control the system unit. For example, a left or right movement of the system unit may be used by the processor to change menu items displayed on the display. For example, the processor may use the information for a left movement to scroll menu items on the display to the left (e.g., scroll a first menu item left and off of the display to display a second menu item on the display). The processor may use the information for a right movement of the system unit to scroll menu items to the right (e.g., scroll a first menu item right and off of the display, and display a second menu item on the display).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">The HID and processor may be adapted to detect and use various movements to activate a menu item that is displayed on the display. For example, information for an upward movement or a downward movement may be detected and used to activate a menu item that is displayed on the display. For example, if a user is prepared to take an oximeter measurement and a menu option is displayed for taking an oximeter measurement, a quick downward movement of the system unit may start a measurement when the probe tip is placed in contact with tissue</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">The HID may include one or more accelerometers to detect motion in various directions (e.g., linear, rotational, or both). The accelerometers can include one or more capacitive micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices, one or more piezoresistive devices, one or more piezoelectric devices, or any combination of these devices.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">In an embodiment, accelerometer <b>332</b> is adapted to detect relatively high G-force accelerations associated with a shock that the system unit experiences. The shock may be from bumping the system into something, dropping the system unit (e.g., dropping the system unit on a table or the floor), or other shock events. In an implementation, if the accelerometer indicates to the processor that a shock event has occurred, the processor can take a number of actions. For example, the processor can shut down the system unit. The processor can display one or more messages on the display. The messages may indicate that the system unit should be recalibrated. The message may indicate that contact between the system unit and the sheath should be checked. The accelerometer may include one or more capacitive micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices, one or more piezoresistive devices, one or more piezoelectric devices, or any combination of these devices.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">The nonvolatile memory <b>315</b> may include a FLASH memory, other nonvolatile solid-state storage (e.g., USB flash drive), battery-backed-up volatile memory, tape storage, reader, and other similar media, and combinations of these. In some implementations, the nonvolatile memory includes a mass disk drive, magnetic disks, optical disks, magneto-optical disks, fixed disks, hard disks, CD-ROMs, recordable CDs, DVDs, recordable DVDs (e.g., DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, HD-DVD, or Blu-ray Disc). The volatile memory may include a random access memory (RAM).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">The processor may include a microcontroller, a microprocessor, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), programmable logic (e.g., field programmable gate array), or any combination of these circuits, such as a microprocessor and an FPGA or a microcontroller and an FPGA. The processor may include multiple processors or a multicore processor, which may permit parallel processing of information.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\">In an implementation, the system unit is part of a distributed system. In a distributed system, individual systems are connected to a network and are available to lend resources to another system in the network as needed. For example, a single system unit may be used to collect results from numerous sensor probes at different locations.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\">Aspects of the invention may include software executable code, firmware (e.g., code stored in a read only memory (ROM) chip), or both. The software executable code or firmware may embody algorithms used in making oxygen saturation measurements of the tissue. The software executable code or firmware may include code to implement a user interface by which a user uses the system, displays results on the display, selects or specifies parameters that affect the operation of the system, or execute algorithms and calculations to generate a result.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\">Further, a computer-implemented or computer-executable version of the invention may be embodied using, stored on, or associated with a computer-readable medium. A computer-readable medium may include any medium that participates in providing instructions to one or more processors for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, nonvolatile, volatile, and transmission media. Nonvolatile media includes, for example, flash memory, or optical or magnetic disks. Volatile media includes static or dynamic memory, such as cache memory or RAM. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire, fiber optic lines, and wires arranged in a bus. Transmission media can also take the form of electromagnetic, radio frequency, acoustic, or light waves, such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\">For example, a binary, machine-executable version, of the software of the present invention may be stored or reside in RAM or cache memory, or on a mass storage device. Source code of the software of the present invention may also be stored or reside on a mass storage device (e.g., hard disk, magnetic disk, tape, or CD-ROM). As a further example, code of the invention may be transmitted via wires, radio waves, or through a network such as the Internet. Firmware may be stored in a ROM of the system.</p>\n",

The computer software product may be an independent application with data input and data display modules. Alternatively, the computer software products may be classes that may be instantiated as distributed objects. The computer software products may also be component software such as Java Beans (from Sun Microsystems) or Enterprise Java Beans (EJB from Sun Microsystems).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\">An operating system for the system may be one of the Microsoft Windows&#174; family of operating systems (e.g., Windows XP, Windows XP x64 Edition, Windows Vista, Windows CE, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Mobile), Linux, HP-UX, UNIX, Solaris, Mac OS X, Alpha OS, AIX, IRIX32, or IRIX64. Microsoft Windows is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation. Other operating systems may be used, including custom and proprietary operating systems.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\">Furthermore, the system may be connected to a network and may communicate with other systems using this network. The network may be an intranet, internet, or the Internet, among others. The network may be a wired network (e.g., using copper), telephone network, packet network, an optical network (e.g., using optical fiber), or a wireless network, or any combination of these. For example, data and other information may be passed between the computer and components (or steps) of a system of the invention using a wireless network using a protocol such as Wi-Fi (IEEE standards 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11e, 802.11g, 802.11i, and 802.11n, just to name a few examples).

For example, the nonvolatile memory of the system unit may store an identifier of a system unit. The processor of the system unit may transfer the system identifier of the system unit to the power block for storage in the power block's memory. In an implementation, the system unit tests the battery use by a threshold that is greater than zero (e.g., usage number stored in the battery's memory), to handle the case of someone accidentally disconnecting the battery before insertion into the sheath. If the system unit checked a usage of zero versus nonzero, then the battery would be rejected for use for the accidental battery disconnection situation. A threshold greater than zero allows for the system unit test to not interrupt the workflow of connecting the battery and placing the battery in the sheath. That is, the implementation attempts to ensure that a power block is fully charged and can be used for the duration of a medical procedure (e.g., a surgery) without the power block running out of stored energy. Ensuring that a power block is unused prior to using the power block during a medical procedure provides that the power block will not run out of power during the procedure and minimize risk to a patient.

In an implementation, an oximetry reading is the instantaneous oxygen saturation StO2 that is calculated by the system unit at any given time, based on the system unit sequencing through the lighting of the system unit's various LEDs (light emitting diodes), and measuring, by the unit's one or more detectors, intensities of the light after being transmitted through the illuminated tissue. An oximetry reading can further include the system unit performing various operations on the collected and measured light, such as performing one or more of digitization, various comparisons, calibration adjustments, calculations, memory storage operations, other operations, or any combination of these operations.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0241\" num=\"0238\">As described briefly above, oximetry readings are taken by the system unit's processor at a variable rate, between 0.5 hertz and 3.2 hertz, where the variability of the rate is dependent on the requirements of a thermal control measurement system and various thermal algorithms operated by the system unit. In other implementations, the rate can be above 3.2 hertz, such as from about 4 hertz to about 1 kilohertz. The system unit's ADC can sample measurement information generated by the system unit's photodetectors at a higher rate, such as about 200-300 kilohertz. In an implementation, a most recent oximetry reading value is displayed on the display. In an implementation, subsequent to an oximetry reading value being displayed on the display, the oximetry reading value is stored in one of the system unit's memory devices, such as the system unit's flash memory. Storage and use of oximetry reading values by the system unit are described further below.</p>\n",

The location where the oximetry reading values are displayed on the display is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;live&#8221; field because every two seconds, for example, the system unit controls the display to display whatever the most recent oximetry reading value that the system unit has generated.

      "<p id=\"p-0244\" num=\"0241\">The following description describes the use of the system unit located in the sheath. The following description applies equally to the use of the system unit without the sheath. The system unit makes a &#8220;measurement&#8221; during a time period when a sensor window of the sheath is placed into contact with tissue by a user and is removed from contact with the tissue. The system unit can make a number of readings (e.g., five readings) when the sensor window of the sheath is placed into contact with tissue and then removed from contact with the tissue for the number of times (e.g., five series of contact and subsequent lift from contact events). When a current oximetry reading value is displayed on the display and the value is stored in memory, a time value for a time that oximetry reading is display on the display is stored in a memory of the system unit. When the oximetry reading value is displayed on the display for a time that is greater than a threshold time (e.g., about 1.5 seconds to about 3 seconds, such as about 2 seconds), a new oximetry reading value is displayed on the display. Prior to the new oximetry reading being displayed on the display for the threshold time, each most recent oximetry reading value is stored in memory. In a specific implementation, only the most recent oximetry reading value that is displayed on the display is stored in memory.</p>\n",

Through the sensor window, the system unit can emit light into tissue from the source structures and detect the light subsequent to the light traveling through the tissue. Light can include visible light (e.g., red light), infrared (e.g., near-infrared light), or both visible light and infrared (IR).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0246\" num=\"0243\">In an implementation, the system unit averages a number of oximetry reading values from a corresponding number of measurements. As described briefly above, the system unit stores an oximetry reading value from a measurement in the unit's memory, such as the unit's flash memory. Each stored oximetry reading value is the n&#8722;1 oximetry reading value of n oximetry reading values generated by the system unit. When a new oximetry reading value (n value) is displayed on the display, the subsequently displayed oximetry reading value (n&#8722;1) is stored in the memory. Each oximetry reading value that is stored in the memory is overwritten by a new n&#8722;1 oximetry reading value. Storing and overwriting is a continuous process for each measurement (e.g., a placement on tissue and a subsequent lift from the tissue after the placement) that the system unit makes.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0247\" num=\"0244\">When a user removes the sheath from contact with tissue and a measurement is concluded, the system unit uses the oximetry reading value stored in memory for generating an average of oximetry reading values. Each nth oximetry reading value for a measurement is not stored in the memory and is not used for generating an average of oximetry reading values because there is a possibility that the sheath was in poor contact or out of contact with the tissue when the nth oximetry reading value was generated. Thus, each nth oximetry reading value may not be an accurate value of the oxygen saturation of the tissue. Thus, the n&#8722;1 (second to last) oximetry reading values of measurement are used by the system unit to generate an average. The system unit briefly displays the text &#8220;Saved NN %&#8221; <b>3130</b> in the center field of the display, indicating that a particular oximetry reading value has been saved to the memory and thus indicating that the value will be used by the system unit to generate the average. <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows the display with the &#8220;Saved NN %&#8221; message in the center field of the display.

      "<p id=\"p-0278\" num=\"0274\">In an implementation, at <b>3600</b> a sensor window of the sheath with the system unit located in the sheath is placed into contact with tissue to be measured. The source structures of the system unit can direct light (e.g., visible, near infrared, or both) into the tissue through the sensor window. After the light is transmitted through the tissue, the detectors structures of the system unit can detect the tissue. At <b>3605</b>, the system unit digitizes light information generated by the detectors in response to the detected light. The digitized values can be adjusted using one or more calibration coefficients stored in the memory of the system unit. At <b>3610</b>, the system unit generates oximetry reading values from the digitized information. The other intermediate values in a calculation can also be generated, such as absorption coefficient, reduced absorption coefficients, or other values. At <b>3615</b>, the system unit performs error checking, an oximetry reading value update rate, other logic, one of these processes, or any combination of these processes. At <b>3620</b>, the system unit generates values for the live oximetry reading values. At <b>3635</b>, the system unit generates the values for the measurement averages. The oximetry reading values, the measurement averages, and the number of measurements in an average are provided to the display for display at <b>3635</b>. At <b>3630</b>, the system unit generates information from physical input from various modules of the system unit, such as the accelerometer. The accelerometer can provide information for inversion of the system unit for resetting information for the oximetry readings, the measurement averages, and the number of measurements in an average. The physical input information is provided to the display at <b>3635</b> for control of the display to display reset information or other physical information.

The background information may not need to be rewritten on the display unless the displayed information is replaced with other information that does not use the background, such as a warning that is displayed on the display. Transferring the background information to the display from the display control reduces the amount of information that has to be refreshed on the display when new information is displayed on the display. For example, information in the fields in which numerical values are displayed, the central field in which text information is displayed, the battery indicator, and the quality information display can be provided from the display controller circuit to the display independently from the information for the background screen and the display can update the displayed information for these fields independently from the background. Updating the information in the described fields allows for the information in these fields to be updated relatively quickly so that a user of the system unit is relatively quickly shown stable or changing oximetry information, which the system unit generates for a patient's tissue.

The probe unit can be reused after the surgery and the laparoscopic tube can be discarded. The probe unit can be cleaned after the surgery and connected to a different laparoscopic tube to form another laparoscopic oximeter. The probe unit can thereafter be used in a different surgery. The probe unit is sometimes referred to as a durable unit because this unit is reusable, whereas the laparoscopic tube is sometimes referred to as a disposable unit because it is to be disposed of after use on a patient.</p>\n",

In a further implementation, the laparoscopic oximeter is configured to reset or erase one or more pieces of oximetry information, average oximetry information, and reset the display of the laparoscopic oximeter as described above. For example, the laparoscopic oximeter can reset or erase the number of measurements in average <b>3110</b>, the average over multiple measurements <b>3105</b>, the real-time StO2 <b>3100</b>, and reset the display of these values on the display of the laparoscopic oximeter.

The upward direction out of the plane of the page is indicated by a circle with a dot inside of the circle (e.g., diagram of an arrow pointing out of the page). <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> shows the laparoscopic oximeter at a second time. The laparoscopic oximeter at the second time is oriented in a second rotational direction (e.g., display <b>205</b> pointing downward and not shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, battery compartment <b>207</b> facing up, and finger rest <b>291</b><i>a </i>facing up) indicated by axis <b>4020</b> pointing into the plane of the page. The downward direction into the plane of the page is indicated by a circle with a cross inside of the circle (e.g., diagram of an arrow pointing into the page). The first time can be before the second time. The central axis <b>4000</b> of the laparoscopic oximeter can be approximately perpendicular to the direction of the acceleration of gravity vector (e.g., parallel to the floor of the operating room in which the patient is located).</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0317\" num=\"0311\">Rotation of the laparoscopic oximeter about axis <b>4000</b> through a predetermined number of degrees initiates the laparoscopic oximeter to perform the reset and erasure of values described above for generating an average oximetry value and resetting the display as described above. The number of degrees of rotation about axis <b>4000</b> can be about 90-160 degrees to affect the resets, erasures, or both.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0318\" num=\"0312\">In an implementation, accelerometer <b>332</b> detects the rotation of the laparoscopic oximeter about central axis <b>4000</b>. Accelerometer <b>332</b> can be a two axes accelerometer, a three axes accelerometer, or two two-axes accelerometers. The accelerometer can be mounted in the laparoscopic oximeter (e.g., on a PCB) so that the accelerometer can detect rotation about central axis <b>4000</b>. In various implementations, the accelerometer can detect rotation about one, two, or three axes of rotation or any combination of these axes of rotation. In an implementation, the accelerometer can detect the rotation of the laparoscopic oximeter with respect to the vector for the acceleration of gravity. The accelerometer can detect a change in the rotational direction about axis <b>4000</b> with respect to the acceleration of gravity vector. In an implementation, the average information is reset by an impulse motion applied to the laparoscopic oximeter.

      "<p id=\"p-0319\" num=\"0313\">The accelerometer, the processor, or both can implement hysteresis so that the laparoscopic oximeter does not reset the averaging information and measurements when not intended.

      "<p id=\"p-0320\" num=\"0314\">For example, the laparoscopic oximeter can be rotated about axis <b>4000</b> by about 90 degrees to about 160 degrees (e.g., solid line in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>) from the orientation of the laparoscopic oximeter shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> to the orientation of the oximeter shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> for the averaging information to reset including the information displayed on the display. In an embodiment, the rotation about axis <b>4000</b> is 135 degrees for the averaging information to reset. The laparoscopic oximeter can thereafter be returned from the rotated orientation (e.g., <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> orientation) to the unrotated orientation (e.g., <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> orientation). The laparoscopic oximeter will not be able to perform another reset of the averaging information until the rotational orientation of the laparoscopic oximeter is returned to about 45 degrees or less (e.g., the dashed line shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>) from the unrotated orientation shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> from the rotated orientation shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>.</p>\n",

For example, oximeters are used for medical and diagnostic purposes in hospitals and other medical facilities (e.g., operating rooms for surgery, recovery room for patient monitoring, or ambulance or other mobile monitoring for, e.g., hypoxia); sports and athletic purposes at a sports arena (e.g., professional athlete monitoring); personal or at-home monitoring of individuals (e.g., general health monitoring, or person training for a marathon); and veterinary purposes (e.g., animal monitoring).',\n",
       " \"In particular, assessing a patient's oxygen saturation, at both the regional and local levels, is important as it is an indicator of the state of the patient's health. Thus, oximeters are often used in clinical settings, such as during surgery and recovery, where it can be suspected that the patient's tissue oxygenation state is unstable. For example, during surgery, oximeters should be able to quickly deliver accurate oxygen saturation measurements under a variety of non-ideal conditions.\",\n",
       " 'Pulse oximeters and tissue oximeters are two types of oximeters that operate on different principles. A pulse oximeter requires a pulse in order to function. A pulse oximeter typically measures the absorbance of light due to pulsing arterial blood. In contrast, a tissue oximeter does not require a pulse in order to function, and can be used to make oxygen saturation measurements of a tissue flap that has been disconnected from a blood supply.',\n",
       " 'Human tissue, as an example, includes a variety of light-absorbing molecules. Such chromophores include oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, melanin, water, lipid, and cytochrome. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins are the dominant chromophores in tissue for much of the visible and near-infrared spectral range. Light absorption differs significantly for oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins at certain wavelengths of light. Tissue oximeters can measure oxygen levels in human tissue by exploiting these light-absorption differences.',\n",
       " 'Despite the success of existing oximeters, there is a continuing desire to improve oximeters by, for example, improving the reuse of oximeters; reducing or eliminating contamination during use; improving remote communication; improving measurement accuracy; reducing measurement time; lowering cost through reuse; reducing size, weight, or form factor; reducing power consumption; and for other reasons, and any combination of these.',\n",

For example, during surgery, oximeters should be able to quickly deliver accurate oxygen saturation measurements under a variety of non-ideal conditions.</p>\n",

The averages are not generated if the lifts are not made while the user directions for the lifts are not displayed. The averages are simultaneously displayed with the oximetry readings which are instantaneous measurement for patient tissue. The averaging allows a user of the oximetry device to monitor the oximetry information as an average as tissue conditions of the tissue change during a surgery. Being able to monitor how the average value changes over time by viewing the average displayed on the display allows the user to obtain a history of the tissue during the surgery to perform more successful surgeries, such as tissue flap surgeries where real-time and average oximetry information of a tissue flap allows for the flap to be trimmed or not trimmed based on the real-time and average information for more successful flap grafting.',\n",

Human tissues, for example, include numerous light-absorbing chromophores, such as oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, melanin, water, lipid, and cytochrome. The hemoglobins are the dominant chromophores in tissue for much of the visible and near-infrared spectral range and via light absorption, contribute to the color of human tissues. In the visible and near-infrared range, oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins have significantly different absorption features. Accordingly, visible and near-infrared spectroscopy has been applied to exploit these different absorption features for measuring oxygen levels in physiological media, such as tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sometimes referred to as oxygen saturation) and total hemoglobin concentrations.',\n",
       " 'Spatially-resolved spectroscopy (SRS) is one type of visible and near-infrared spectroscopy that allows tissue absorption to be determined independently from tissue scattering, thereby allowing absolute measurements of chromophore concentrations, such as oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins. More specifically, an SRS instrument may emit light into tissue through a light source and collect the diffusely reflected light at two or more detectors positioned at different distances from the light source.',\n",
       " 'One field in which visible and near-infrared spectroscopy, such as SRS, is useful in tissue flap surgery in which a tissue flap is moved from one location on a patient to another location for reconstructive surgery. Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy techniques can be used to measure oxygen saturation in a tissue flap so that the viability of the tissue flap can be determined in surgery and after surgery. Intraoperative tissue flap oximetry probes that employ visible and near-infrared SRS should be able to quickly deliver accurate oxygen saturation measurements under a variety of non-ideal conditions.',\n",

And then after returning the probe to its standard operating orientation, the average value will be reset or initialized, and calculating of the average value will start at a count of 1.

Transferring the background information to the display from the display control reduces the amount of information that has to be refreshed on the display when new information is displayed on the display. For example, information in the fields in which numerical values are displayed, the central field in which text information is displayed, the battery indicator, and the quality information display can be provided from the display controller circuit to the display independently from the information for the background screen and the display can update the displayed information for these fields independently from the background. Updating the information in the described fields allows for the information in these fields to be updated relatively quickly so that a user of the system unit is relatively quickly shown stable or changing oximetry information, which the system unit generates for a patient's tissue.
